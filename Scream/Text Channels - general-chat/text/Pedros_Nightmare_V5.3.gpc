1) Join the discord  https://discord.gg/6wvvgJU4ZM
2) THIS SCRIPT IT 32 BIT.
   USE THE LATESt ZEN STUDIOS AND FIRMWARE.
   MAKE SURE USE LEGACY 16 BIT COMPILER IS UNCHECKED IN THE DEVICE TAB OR YOU WILL GET AN ERROR.
3) Plug and play is the best option for people that dont want to put work into custom sens.
4) Custom sens you will have to put some work into and ammo. Read everything below.
5) READ EVERYTHING BELOW . IT EXPLAINS EVERYTHING. ALOT HAS CHANGED.

Alot of stuff have changed but here are some of the major points.

1) New Menu for the script.
2) Polar Anti recoil.
3) You will notice the custom sens values for the guns will be able to go up or down to 99.99% If you did values for a previous
   version of the script just simply start off with that number. So a 15 would be 15.00% This is where you will be able to fine tune your custom
   sens even more.
   -You will also be able to tweak the recoil for plug and play settings. I would try to keep the value under 01.00%
3) More Mods.
4) Ability to remap certain buttons on the zen.
5) Ability to assign mods to the quick toggle.
6) Custom sens will have the ablity to fine tune their values even more.
7) All anti Recoil Is for standing. Only M249 has a crouch and standing profile.
8) Weapon Quick toggle now has a hold of 300ms. You must Hold L2 / LT and Hold R3 or the button you have it mapped to.
   This was done to stop accidental changes of weapons
9) All button remaps are done on the zen. If you had your Triggers flipped or R3 and Circle / B remapped on the console. Please undo that
   and remap them in the temap menu on the scrip

	- FIRST Reset your in game values and match the ones that are listed below.
	- SECOND you have two options for plug and play values that work. You do not need to adjust anything besides ingame settings.
	- THIRD There are two different types of deadzones. Ingame deadzone and Script deadzone. 
		Ingame Deadzone must remain 1 and 1.
		Script deadzone acts as your ingame deadzone to stop stickdrift. SCRIPT DEADZONE has a default of 15 but can be changed. See below
	- ALL ANTI RECOIL IS FOR STANDING UNLESS YOUR USING M2 WHICH HAS A STANDING AND CROUCHING PROFILE.

1) You have two differnt ways you can quick toggle weapons. now
	-You can Hold L2 and Press and hold R3 or the button you changed it to in the remap menu to cycle the weapons now. 
	-You need to hold R3 or the button you changed it to in the remap menu for 200 MS before it changes the gun.
	-This was done to stop accidental changes of the gun. 
		-Just a side note if you swap L1 and L2 in the remap menu you you have to hold L1 and press and hold R3 to use this toggle.
	- The next way now is Hold R1 and Press and Hold Up ,Down , Left or Right on the dpad. This will the weapon to the one you have assigned too it.
	- When you use the Loadout quick toggle now you have assigned to the zen you will notice the number and letter change in the bottom left corner.
	  It aslo changes your weapon to the first profile on that loadout.
		-Just a side note if you swap R1 and R2 in the remap menu you you have to hold R2 and press and hold the dpad to use that toggle.

	- To Turn the script back on Hold R1/RB and double tap circle or b. This works regardless of remaps.

						First off if you are looking for plug and play do not mess with any of the settings for custom sens.
						   The only time it is recomended to change any of them for plug and play is if a semi shoots down.
							   This is not for people that dont want to put work into findingthe values for there sens.
									  Once you find one gun values it should be a good base point for the rest.
	
	1) AFTER YOU FIND THE VALUES FOR YOUR CUSTOM SENS WRITE THEM DOWN. This is due to us using 32 bit and bit packing. 
	   If the scipt is acting weird or you get an error where you have to reset your zen you will lose all the saved values.
	   Thats why we you need to write them down once you find them.
	2) You will have to put some time into finding the values that work for your sens. I will have a channel in the discord with values 
	   that work for custom sens as people find them.
	
	3) If you wish to do custom sens. Find what you like to play at and leave it. Leave in game deadzone at 1 and 1 .
	
	Now lets get into how it works.
	
	1) Each gun has 8 values.
	   -Iron Sight horizontal
	   -Iron Sight Vertical
	   -Holo Horizontal
	   -Holo Vertical   
	   -4X Horizontal
	   -4X Vertical
	   -Hip Fire  Horizontal
	   -Hip Fire  Vertical
	   
	Now lets talk about how to access the menu.
	
	1) Since each gun has 8 values  you need to choose the gun you are doing. 
	   Once you figure out one gun the rest of the guns should be pretty similar.
	2) First enter the main menu Hold L2 / LT + OPTIONS to enter the weapon menu.
	3) Hit LEFT OR RIGHT  to get to the gun you are gonna start finding values for.
	4) Than choose the sight you wish to use.
	5) Than press down to get to the sight editable values.
	6) Press left or right to choose horiztonal or verticle for the sight
	7) Than press down to get to the value.
	8) Press left or right to change it by 00.01% Hold left or right to make it increase or decrease faster.
	
	Now since you figured that out. Lets talk about how you should do this.
	
	1) Find the sens you like playing at.
	2) Shoot the gun. Find out if the gun shoots up or down.
	3) Enter the weapon menu and go to the edtable values for that gun and sight. 
	6) If it shoots down read below.
       -Lower the Horzontal and vertical value . I would do them in the same ammount.
       -Hit the save button PS / XBOX. 
       -Repeat this step until the gun starts to shoot level.
       -If the gun starts to shoot up you need to increase that value
       -Once you get it in the ball park you will need to fine tune you Horzontal and vertical value.
       -they may end up different. 
    7) If it shoots up read below.
       -Raise  the Horzontal and vertical value . I would do them in the same ammount.
       -Hit the save button PS / XBOX. 
       -Repeat this step until the gun starts to shoot level.
       -If the gun starts to shoot down you need to decrease  that value
       -Once you get it in the ball park you will need to fine tune you Horzontal and vertical value.
       -they may end up different.
       
 Once you figure out one gun for all the attachment and hip fire Anti Recoil the rest of the guns should be similar.

3) Just change the 0 to the value you found for that gun and sight.
