	Contains The Following Options :

--------------------------------------------------------

	~ 3 Different Aim Assist, all 3 are customizable on the Zen Screen

	~ 1st Aim Assist is DoGz Polar with Radius and Angle Boost, uses raw genuine Polar and AA cuts out when pressure is applied to the look axis. (Radius is on top and Angle is on bottom, Tap R1/RB to go to next page and change Radius/Angle Boost)

	~ 2nd Aim Assist is DoNotAtME Polar customized by TaylorDrift21 to have 13 customizable Aim Assist Patterns. Aim Assist also has Directional Angle meaning Aim Assist will spin in the direction you're scanning

	~ 3rd Aim Assist is Triple Sticky, Idea made by me and Chi Chi but it originated with Batts Sticky Aim Assist, we just added the ability to have it activated on ADS, ADS + Fire and Hipfire.

	~ Aim Abuse this mod just Aims in and Out repeatedly while ADS button is held. Can sometimes be useful in some situations

	~ Aim Corrections, basically the value you choose on screen is subtracted by 100 and that's what your look axis is restricted too when enabled. So if you have Aim Corrections at 10 then your stick axis will be restricted to 90 instead of 100 (Value adjustable on Zen Screen)

	~ Anti Recoil incase you need to level out your weapons kick (Strength adjustable on Zen Screen)

	~ Rapid Fire works great for semi auto weapons (Speed is adjustable on Zen Screen, the higher the value the slower the speed)

	~ 2 Types of Drop Shot Mod, Standard Drop Shot is active on Fire and Nikos Drop Shot works great in some situations so the enemy has to follow up and down whenever you're firing (Speed adjustable on Zen Screen, When activated and holding the FIRE button, tap crouch and it will perform the mod)

	~ Pump / SmG when activated and your pump is pulled out and you press fire once it'll automatically switch over to your SmG after firing that pump shot

	~ Pump Wall when activated and you fire one shot it will automatically build a wall afterwards

	~ Chicken Mode this mode works great in some situations so it makes it harder for the enemy to hit you because your character will be strafing side to side while crouching up and down all at once

	~ Fast Reset when enabled and you press the FAST_RESET_BUTTON it'll very quickly reset your build

	~ Edit Assist, I'm not 100% what this mod does but I think it cuts your look axis in half when editing your builds

	~ Ramp Floor Wall, when enabled and you press the RFW_Button it'll build a ramp, floor and wall for you. Recommended to press while your sprinting forward

	~ Safety Box when enabled and you press the UNBOUND_BUTTON while standing still it'll build a little 1x1 box for you to keep you safe for the moment (make sure that button you set is unbounded in game too!) 

	~ Window Edit Shot when enabled and you press the UNBOUND_BUTTON it'll build a wall, edit a window then shoot 1 shot

	~ 1 Shot Accuracy is enabled by default, when you Hold L1 and press R1 it'll fire your gun once. This is best for the any weapons that crosshair steady in such as the old school AR and SCAR

	~ Anti Bloom Reducer, seems to work quite well to slightly reduce in-game bloom

	~ Slide Shot mod, when activated hold forward and the FIRE button

	~ Strafe Mod, speed is adjustable on Zen OLED screen

	~ Head Shot Assist at a set strength and set amount of time to be active, both adjustable in the OLED menu

	All options and values will save to the device so you don't need to keep putting in values every time you load the script on your device. The only way the values will go away is if you remove the script from your device slots.
