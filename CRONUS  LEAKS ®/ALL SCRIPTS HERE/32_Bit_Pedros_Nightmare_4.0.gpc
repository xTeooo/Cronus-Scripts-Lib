This script was a collaboration between JT0810 and myself Jbaze122.
Thanks To Myshotsfullwhite for the jackhammer and afk script.
Big thanks to Draka Traps and Redox for extensive testing they did.
I just want to give credit to LegitCloudzzz for helping out with the simplified code and helping me out when I got stuck. 
Also to Noozbar's for have this awesome menu template on W&K that we were able to adapt to the script.

	Deadzone - You can adjust the deadzone for the left and right stick.  This is for if you have stick drift on the map.
	
	Auto Strafe - You have a start delay and strafe time. Start delay means how long you have to hold L2/LT + R2 / RT  for it to activate, strafe time is how long you strafe in that direction. 
		
	Crouch Spam - You have a start delay and crouch time. Start delay means how long you have to hold crouch for it to activate, crouch time is how long you are crouched. 
	
	AUTO CODE LOCK - WHEN YOU PRESS LEFT OR RIGHT IT CHANGES BETWEEN THE FIRST AND FOURTH DIGIT OF THE CODE. YOU HAVE TO HOLD CROSSS / A  + UP,DOWN,LEFT or right to change it. 
					 WHEN TURNED	ON WHEN YOU HOLD L1 / LB AND PRESS TRIANGLE / Y ON THE CODELOCK IT WILL ENTER THE CODE YOU SET,

	Inverted - No edit avaiable.
	
	HIP SENS. , HOLO SENS. ,IRON SENS. 4X SENS.
	
		- THIS I WILL GO INTO DETAIL HOW IT WORKS.
		- EACH ONE IS LINKED TO THE ATTAHCMENT YOU HAVE ON YOUR GUN.
		- HIP SENS IS FOR LOOKING AROUND WHILE NOT AIMING.
		- HOLO , IRON , 4X IS LINKED TO THE ATTACHMENT. NORMAL RECOIL IS LINKED TO IRON.
		- FIRST OFF YOU PLAY ON PLUG AND PLAY SETTINGS.
		
		-If the plug and play settings are to FAST for you while aiming follow the instruction below.
			1) This is an example and you will need to adjust it for your play style.
			1) Start with the Iron Sight. Turn it on in the mod menu and hit Square / X on it and it will open the mod edit menu.
			2) Set the vertical and horizontal to -40.
			3) Press Save PS or XBox Button.
			5) Make sure you have a weapon with the IRON SIGHT on. It will tell you the weapon and attachment that is active on the Pedro's Nightmare Screen.
			6) Now aim down sight. You will notice it is far slower now. 
			7) The vertical is probaly too slow since rust has a messed up Vertical axis.
			8) Enter the mod menu again and change the vertical to -20. Save and Exit and  you will notice the Vertical axis is faster now.
			9) My suggestion is getting the horizontal to where you like it that adjust the vertical to speed it up.
			10) Just remember if you have a horztal value say of -50 your vertical will be say -30 since you dont want to slow it down as much as the horizontal.
			
			-If the plug and play settings are too SLOW for you while aiming follow the instruction below.
			1) This is an example and you will need to adjust it for your play style.
			1) Start with the Iron Sight. Turn it on in the mod menu and hit Square / X on it and it will open the mod edit menu.
			2) Set the vertical and horizontal to 50.
			3) Press Save PS or XBox Button.
			5) Make sure you have a weapon with the IRON SIGHT on. It will tell you the weapon and attachment that is active on the Pedro's Nightmare Screen.
			6) Now aim down sight. You will notice it is much faster now. 
			7) The vertical is probaly too slow since rust has a messed up Vertical axis.
			8) Enter the mod menu again and change the vertical to 70. Save and Exit and  you will notice the Vertical axis is faster now.
			9) My suggestion is getting the horizontal to where you like it that adjust the vertical to speed it up.
			10) Just remember if you have a horztal value say of 50 your vertical will be say 70 since you want to speed it up to match the horizontal.

						First off if you are looking for plug and play do not mess with any of the settings for custom sens.
						   The only time it is recomended to change any of them for plug and play is if a semi shoots down.
							   This is not for people that dont want to put work into findingthe values for there sens.
									  Once you find one gun values it should be a good base point for the rest.
	
	1) AFTER YOU FIND THE VALUES FOR YOUR CUSTOM SENS WRITE THEM DOWN. This is due to us using 32 bit and bit packing. 
	   If the scipt is acting weird or you get an error where you have to reset your zen you will lose all the saved values.
	   Thats why we you need to write them down once you find them.
	2) You will have to put some time into finding the values that work for your sens. I will have a channel in the discord with values 
	   that work for custom sens as people find them.
	
	3) If you wish to do custom sens. Find what you like to play at and leave it. Leave in game deadzone at 1 and 1 .
	
	Now lets get into how it works.
	
	1) Each gun has 8 values.
	   -Iron Sight horizontal
	   -Iron Sight Vertical
	   -Holo Horizontal
	   -Holo Vertical   
	   -4X Horizontal
	   -4X Vertical
	   -Hip Fire  Horizontal
	   -Hip Fire  Vertical
	   
	Now lets talk about how to access the menu.
	
	1) Since each gun has 8 values  you need to choose the gun you are doing. 
	   Once you figure out one gun the rest of the guns should be pretty similar.
	2) First enter the main menu Hold L2 / LT + OPTIONS to enter the main menu.
	3) Hit LEFT OR RIGHT  to get to the gun you are gonna start finding values for.
	4) Press Square / X to enter Custom Sens Menu.
	5) Press Left and Right to cycle the attachment  values listed above.
	6) Hold Cross / A  and hitting up or down increases or decreases the value by 10.
	7) Hold Cross / A  and hitting left  or right  increases or decreases the value by 1.
	
	Now since you figured that out. Lets talk about how you should do this.
	
	1) Find the sens you like playing at.
	2) Shoot the gun. Find out if the gun shoots up or down.
	3) Enter the main menu and hit left or right till you find the gun you are using.
	4) Enter the Custom Sens menus by hitting Square / X while on the gun.
	5) Hit left or right on the dpad till you find the attachment you are using for that gun.
	   Remember each attachment has a horzontal and vertical adjustment.
	6) If it shoots down read below.
       -Find the attachment you have on the gun using left or right on the dpad once in the custom sens menu. 
       -Lower the Horzontal and vertical value . I would do them in the same ammount.
       -Hit the save button PS / XBOX. 
       -Repeat this step until the gun starts to shoot level.
       -If the gun starts to shoot up you need to increase that value
       -Once you get it in the ball park you will need to fine tune you Horzontal and vertical value.
       -they may end up different. 
    7) If it shoots up read below.
       -Find the attachment you have on the gun using left or right on the dpad once in the custom sens menu. 
       -Raise  the Horzontal and vertical value . I would do them in the same ammount.
       -Hit the save button PS / XBOX. 
       -Repeat this step until the gun starts to shoot level.
       -If the gun starts to shoot down you need to decrease  that value
       -Once you get it in the ball park you will need to fine tune you Horzontal and vertical value.
       -they may end up different.
       
 Once you figure out one gun for all the attachment and hip fire Anti Recoil the rest of the guns should be similar.

This section is mainly for plug and play when the semis are shooting down.
ALSO MAKE SURE YOUR NOT CROUCHING WITH SEMIS OR THEY WILL SHOOT DOWN.

	1) Since each gun has 8 values  you need to choose the gun you are doing. 
	   Once you figure out one gun the rest of the guns should be pretty similar.
	2) First enter the main menu Hold L2 / LT + OPTIONS to enter the main menu.
	3) Hit left or right  to find the semi that is shooting down.
	4) Press Square / X to enter Custom Sens Menu.
	5) Press Left and Right to cycle the attachment  values listed above.
	6) Hold Crosss / A  and hitting up or down increases or decreases the value by 10.
	7) Hold Crosss / A  and hitting left  or right  increases or decreases the value by 1.

    8) If it shoots down read below.
       -Find the attachment you have on the gun using left or right on the dpad once in the custom sens menu. 
       -Lower the  vertical value . 
       -Hit the save button PS / XBOX. 
       -Repeat this step until the gun starts to shoot level.
       -If the gun starts to shoot up you need to increase that value
