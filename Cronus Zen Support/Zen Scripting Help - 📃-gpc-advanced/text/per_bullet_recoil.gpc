thanks for helping guys, its truly going to make this so much easier for me and the payout will be great for all of us, this script will be top notch when these anti recoils are dialed in.  I need to explain how to use this so you guys can help
first its CRUCIAL THAT YOUR INGAME SETTINGS MATCH MINE,  if they dont any work you do on the recoils wont matter.  if you play different settings i can make it match yours in the final product but for the base level ar i need it to be consistent.




once youve set you in game settings to mine. you need to choose a gun to do.  here is th elist with the associated number to the gun.

in the firing range you will pick up the gun you want to work on, and ONLY ATTACK A GOLD MAG TO IT (NO SIGHTS, NO BARRELS, NO STOCKS)
its crucial again that all of these AR numbers are the baseline, i can later math it to fit with sights and barrels.

once that is done you want this script.

this is the screen that appears on the zen 

the top left side small number is going to be the gun you pick you change this by HOLDING L1 and pressing TRIANGLE to increase or CIRCLE to decrease

the middle left bigger number is going to be the number of the bullet your trying to edit (this will change the values on the right side as you cycle through them.  change this by pressing up or down d pad while NOT HOLDING L2

the bottom left smaller number is a shot limiter, for example if you change this to 5 your gun will only shoot 5 bullets. change this by pressing right or left dpad while NOT HOLDING l2

the right top side is your vertical value for the bullet (middle number left side) higher the value the more the gun pulls down, lower the value the less a gun pulls down change this by HOLDING L2 and pressing up to increase, down to decrease

the right middle side is your horizontal vlaue for the bullet (middle number left side) higher the value the more the gun pulls right, lower the value the less a gun pulls left. change this by HOLDING L2 and pressing right to increase and left to decrease

the right bottom side is your time per bullet from the start change this by HOLDING L2 and pressing TRIANGLE to increase or CIRCLE to decrease

the easiest way ive found to do this is one bullet at a time, you need to have the right gun selected, and start by setting your shot limit to 02 this will fire only 2 bullets, change the bullets values to adjust the recoil to get the tightest spread possible

IF YOU SET SHOT LIMIT TO A NUMBER AND THE GUN DOES NOT SHOOT THE CORRECT NUMBER OF BULLETS you need to adjust time, usually increasing the bullet before 
for example if you set shot limit to 06 and the gun shoots 7 bullets you need to increase bullet 6's time by 10 at a time until the gun shoots 6 bullets again (usually only 1 or 2 increases it should not be drastic change)

you want to be shooting a wall in the firing range, about 25ish meters away from the wall, you need to see a decent bullet spread before knowing what to adjust so dont be to close to the wall.

its hiiiiiiiiiiighly recomended that after youre happy with a bullet WRITE DOWN THE BULLET NUMBER, VERTICAL VALUE, HORIZONTAL VALUE, TIME.  and then move on.   this script isnt perfect and can error so you dont want to lose all your work.

lastly guns have sway to them while ads'd, shooting the same 2 bullets at a wall 30 times will give different results, so you need to take an average and just move on when its good for most attempts.
