	Using
		
		Mods that are used for each of the weapon selector slots
			
			Three personal weapon slots that are at the top using clicker and auto headshot.
			The left slot at nine o'clock uses the same.
			The slots at 7 o'clocl,at 5 o'clocl and at 3 o'clock don't use any mode.
			The slot at 6 o'clock activates only sniper mode.
			
			!!! The script determines which slot you use after you hold down L1 button and select a weapon. If this did not get the desired result, then just select this weapon again. !!!
			
		Sniper mode
			
			If you choose the botton slot, aim and press RIGHT on D-pad then you will switch modes for the sniper rifle.
				
				Rapid fire for Carcano using crouches glitch mode.                                       (The LED is Green)
				Rapid fire for Carcano using touch panel glitch and horse, also it's rapid fire for bow. (The LED is Red)
				To disable modes for this slot just aim and hold RIGHT on D-pad.                         (The LED is White)
				
			If any of these modes is active, then the sniper rifle hip-fire mode with 100% accuracy will be enabled even with Slippery Bastart.
			The script itself detects when you are in the inventory,pause menu or in the catalog and turns off the sniper mode and cross clicker. Only works when your lightbar is red or green. (The LED is Yellow)
			If you exited the inventory or pause menu and the color light is still yellow just press the cancel button a couple of times or hold it for a second. 
			Pause mode disables the cross clicker. It helps when you prepare tonics. Just hold RIGHT or LEFT on D-pad when your lightbar is red or green and you prepare tonics.
			You do not need to turn on rapid fire every time. The script remembers this for this slot.
			If during aiming you press the L1 key you enable or disable the improved aim assist for sniper rifles, you will also feel the vibration.
